# Image Generation Project

This project is an image generation application built with FastAPI and utilizing various APIs to create images based on user input. The user interface (UI) is currently under development.
The content of this readme file is generated by an LLM.

## Features

*   **Image Generation:** Generates images based on user prompts and specifications.
*   **API-Driven:** Leverages external APIs for image creation. (Specify which APIs are used for clarity).
*   **FastAPI Backend:** Built using FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.
*   **UI in Progress:** A user interface is being developed to provide a user-friendly experience for interacting with the image generation capabilities.

## Technologies Used

*   **FastAPI:** For the backend API.
*   **Python:** Programming language.
*   **(List the APIs used here e.g., Dall-E, Stable Diffusion, etc.):**  For image generation. Example: *Dall-E API*
*   **(List any other libraries or technologies used, e.g., Pydantic, Uvicorn):** Example: *Pydantic for data validation*

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   pip package manager

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd <YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up API Keys:**

    *   Obtain API keys from the image generation services you plan to use (e.g., Dall-E).
    *   Set the API keys as environment variables or in a configuration file.  (Example): `export API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>`  *Be sure not to commit your API keys directly into the repository.*

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the FastAPI server:**

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload  # Assuming your main file is named 'main.py' and your FastAPI app instance is named 'app'
    ```

    This command will start the server, and you should see an output indicating the address where the API is running (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

2.  **Access the API:**

    *   You can access the API endpoints using tools like `curl`, `Postman`, or directly through a web browser.
    *   FastAPI provides automatic interactive API documentation via Swagger UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` and ReDoc at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`.

### UI Development (If applicable)

*   If you're working on the UI, follow the instructions in the `ui` directory (or wherever your UI code is located) for setting up and running the frontend.
*   Make sure the UI is configured to communicate with the FastAPI backend.

## Usage

*   Explain how to use the API endpoints to generate images.  (Example) :
    *   **Endpoint:** `/generate-image`
    *   **Method:** POST
    *   **Request Body:**  `{"prompt": "A cat wearing a hat"}`
    *   **Response:**  `{"image_url": "http://example.com/generated_image.jpg"}`
